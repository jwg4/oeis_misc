# TODO

- The smallest k such that A000001(k) = n
- more A000001 - see the paper with all values up to 2000.
- ~~The nearest integer to n/e, n(1 - 1/e)~~
- The most likely number of values taken by n samples from uniform discrete distribution on n values. 

## Open questions

- ~~nearest integer to n(1 - 1/e) is n - A225593(n) - is this A005206??~~ Different at n=20
